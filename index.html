        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hey there! I'm Pranav, a third-year student at Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai. I will be graduating in the fall of 2024 with a Batchelor's degree 
            in Computer Science and Engineering with a Specialization in Cyber-Physical Systems.Working with technology excites me and during my time at college, 
            I worked on innovative and engaging projects with real-time implementations. I also really enjoy hackathons and have participated in several of them, 
            learning new things in each.<br> I love working on projects where I get to collaborate with people with varied specialties and personalities and I work well in a team. 
            The Internet of Things, Cyber-Physical Systems, and Machine learning are my fields of interest. 
        </p>

                            The Chicago Park District maintains sensors in the water at beaches along Chicago's Lake Michigan lakefront. These sensors generally capture the indicated measurements hourly while the sensors are in operation during the summer. During other seasons and at some other times, information from the sensors may not be available.</td>

                            We made this project for the SharkHacksS3, held by Major League Hacking.
                            <br>We got our dataset from Kagle which is basically Shark attack data. Then we saw the attributes which would be needed to predict and dropped the rest of the columns. Now since most of our attributes are categorical data so we used One-Hot encoding (For: Time column) and Target encoding (For: Country and activities). Now all of our data is in numeric form so then we used SMOTE to balance our data as we had a lot of None-fatal cases compared to fatal-cases. Then we finally used logistic regression to train our model and saved it as a pickle file (Check out the .ipy file in Machine learning directory for complete code).</td>

Futher, an SMS is sent to the users phone with an alert and the time, date and other relevant information are stored in the cloud.</td>
